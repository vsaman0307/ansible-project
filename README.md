# ansible-project

This project will setup webservers and loadbalancer - The webservers and loadbalancer are servers in AWS (already created)

In the ansible-config file, the key-file-name will need to be replaced with the private key file name, which is used to ssh into the servers.

The playbooks folder has all the playbooks that need to be run to set up webservers and loadbalancer

The loadbalancer and webservers (IP addresses) can be invoked via browser to check the results.
